        <h1>IB-MYP&DP Introduction</h1>
        <span>The International Baccalaurate is the international program of successful schools. When a school joins the International Baccalaurate, it officially becomes an international school, meaning that the school gets to join international courses, programs and tournaments. And this improves the school's reputation in real time.</span>

        <span>IB-MYP&DP students can access their homework and materials through the Toddle platform.

        <h2>Exams And Grading System</h2>
