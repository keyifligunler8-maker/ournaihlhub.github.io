    <h2>Article 1 - Nobody Understands Me!</h2>
    <p>Sometimes everyone gets misunderstood. By parents, children etc. But the most important factor of suicide is not giving your teen or child attention and saying: Because I Said So! or not saying the reason of some rules. Raising children is one of the hardest things in life and we, the children need to be understood. Here is a fictional story: I played the kalimba while my parents were fixing the natural gas doğal gaz and my mom said that you shouldn't play the kalimba. I told her that I was playing on low volume but she closed the door without listening because these reasons were only 'excuses'. But It's not an excuse! She waits for me to understand because she cannot express her emotions but the only person who needs to be understood is the child. Or else that valuable treasure will fade and never come again. She could've said that she was getting very disturbed and she couldn't do this chore well and she accidentally spilled a few drops. And she could say that "Even if you play on low volume I heard those high volume sounds of e.g violin ......................... at work today and it was really disturbing me. May you do something else or play in another room?" but when I saw she didn't express herself and give a clear rational expression because 'I needed to be obiedient and do something without knowing the reason but trust my mom' but there are also children who need logic and reasoning before it's too late and the damage is done so I played louder and louder until she took my kalimba so I smashed the curtains. She thinks I'm disrespectful, ungrateful and sassy but in reality I need rationality and understanding everywhere in my life. She thinks I need to shut up but I won't until she takes my opinion but expresses herself. These aren't excuses for children to speak up for themselves even if a trusted adult tells them to do something without knowing the reason. If they could only explain the reason, we wouldn't smash your stuff. If we don't know the reason, we'll use that knowledge and rule wrong so knowing the reason of the rules matter,  even in family and school. We don't talk in class because the attention could be deficit in students and distract them since this is not a 1-on-1 lesson. We don't run in the corridors to make allergic people have an attack. We go to school to learn basic terms that some of them are used in real life. We don't speak bad things to the teacher because they don't do anything wrong and they know what to do; especially calm teachers in Imam Hatip Schools. They can give explanations of things and help a student make empathy along the classmates. But parents? They mess up. They don't use techniques to create awareness on their children. We aren't adults yet. But parents think their children aka we are. Even if we are smart, we can struggle to understand rules with unknown reasons put by parents. So the lesson of the day is to learn how to express our emotions with a help of a counselor or a teacher.</p>
    <h3>How can we use parenting techniques to give our children the attention and understand their struggles and problems even though they are small to stop them from disrespecting us? - Parents</h3>
    <p>We can use the parenting techniques listed below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1- Visualizing: Visualizing is a technique used by top teachers to increase or activate empathy in narcissistic or rational children. Here is an example on how to apply this technique: If a student wants to write on the board about an important subject about class but nobody in the classroom did because of respect and obiedience training, the teacher says: "Visualize what would your classmates do if you wrote on the board now." then lets student B say: "I never saw anyone write on the board in class and I always wanted to, but I couldn't. Now you activated our desires and we'll want to write too! And the lesson will be ended and we'll not be learning anything which is our biggest fear because there are exams. " And they'll say: Can I write too! and the rational student will understand and go back to her or his seat.</li>
        <li>2- Self-Visualizing: If your child cries because her teddy bear was lost, don't say "Stop being dramatic! There's nothing wrong and you're sassy because you're spoiled." Visualize what would you do when you were her age or remind yourself of a similar situation you experienced during childhood but don't beat her but when you understand, say "I understand you, this happened to me too. We can buy a new one with dad's money, my money or with your savings. I know it will never replace your old teddy bear, but the soul of the old teddy bear will live in the new one's." and make your child happy.</li>
        <li>3- Expression of Emotions and unseen experiences: If your child needs to be paid attention, listen to his or her reasons and don't judge them, say: "Even if you play on low volume I heard those high volume sounds of e.g violin ......................... at work today and it was really disturbing me. May you do something else or play in another room?" and he or she will listen to you.</li>
        <li>4- If none on these work, please take your child and yourself to therapy. If you think therapy is useless because one time you went there and it didn't fix you in another town, don't give up. Get help with a therapist or an intelligent calm school teacher.</li>
    </ul>
